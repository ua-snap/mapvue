  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The Arctic and sub-Arctic are warming almost twice as fast as the rest of the world. As a result, people traveling across Interior Alaska are encountering climate-related changes in the environment that are challenging their traditional access to important local resources. There are almost no roads in this region, so travel is mostly by boat and four-wheelers in summer, and by snowmachines or dogsleds in winter.</p>
  <p>Between 2016 and 2017, 26 observers from nine communities in Interior Alaska documented climate-related environmental conditions that were affecting their travel to areas used for hunting, fishing, trapping, and gathering. These conditions included ice, snow, erosion, sedimentation, water levels, vegetation composition, and weather.</p>

  <h2>Ice conditions</h2>
<p>Rivers and lakes have always been efficient &ldquo;highways&rdquo; for snowmachine and dogsled travel. Thick, stable, and predictable ice meant safe and reliable winter travel. Increasingly, this is not what is being experienced by people.</p>
<p>Observers reported rivers and lakes freezing later and thawing earlier than what they experienced in the past. Also, thin ice and open water are becoming more common in midwinter and restricting access to otherwise well used travel routes. Open holes and thin ice throughout winter make for extremely dangerous conditions that have claimed lives. More frequent overflow on river ice slows or reroutes travel. More frequent occurrences of shelf ice forming along riverbanks can pose obstacles to snowmachine routes all winter long.</p>

  <h2>Snow conditions</h2>
  <p>Observers describe that in the past temperatures would drop in September. By October, snow would begin to accumulate and remain all winter. Consistent drops in temperature and dependable snow accumulation provide optimal winter travel conditions by snowmachine and dogsled.</p>
  <p>Recently, delayed and more variable seasonal snow accumulation, as well as precipitation in the form of rain during winter, are making winter travel harder and unpredictable. Rain-on-snow (icing) events are more common, and leave the snowpack crusty, thinner, and hard. Trails are much rougher, can be difficult to traverse, and are hard on sled suspensions and dog feet. It&rsquo;s much easier to get stuck on brush and overheat snowmachines that need a deep, soft snowpack to cool engines. With these changing conditions there is more use of four-wheelers during what had been the winter travel season in the past.</p>

  <h2>River travel and access</h2>
  <p>Rivers in Interior Alaska have always provided critical travel corridors for residents in this mostly-roadless region. For Interior Alaska residents, the Yukon, Tanana, Kuskokwim, and Chandalar rivers are equivalent to major highways around urban areas.</p>
  <p>Once river ice thaws, boats replace snowmachines. Although these rivers always undergo seasonal changes that influence their navigability, those changes have become more erratic. Observers reported rapid bank erosion and unseasonably high or low water. Increased erosion can make boat travel on rivers more dangerous due to the increased amounts of debris in the water, and river channels becoming shallower and wider. Debris can also quickly change otherwise well established river channels. Increased sediment deposition in rivers is increasing the size of sandbars across larger glacier-fed rivers and making some rivers shallower and harder to navigate.</p>
  <p>Changing water levels and shallower rivers impact fishing: locations that have been reliable in the past are no longer a sure bet and sometimes force people to find new spots to fish. Fishing nets or fish wheels snag on the river bottom or fill more quickly with debris, often sustaining damage in the process.</p>
  <p>Unseasonably high or low water in September&mdash;an important time for moose hunting&mdash;can help or hinder hunting. High water on main rivers covers riverbanks where moose might otherwise be found, but can also fill small tributaries that improve hunting access. Abnormally low water prevents access to lakes and sloughs near river channels.</p>

        <q>Huge chunks of land eroding along the Yukon River, large sections of shoreline falling in, even in areas that are not exposed to current (maybe just sunny). This changes the navigability of river channels, because the rate of change has increased. We need to find new fishing spots. You have to watch out for trees falling on you and rolling waves. It has changed historic fishing area for the first time. In 2016 this change was way worse, with way warmer temperatures. There is riverbank erosion in other areas, but this is one of the most severely affected areas. We are trying new spots all the time now, regulations add another layer of challenges.</q>

  <h2>Land travel and access</h2>
  <p>Trails along riverbanks, through the boreal forest, and across wetlands are used year-round. Although trails are always important corridors for accessing resources, trail access across lakes and wetlands is limited in summer by the increased presence of water.</p>
  <p>Trails and roads located close to riverbanks and lakes are increasingly being damaged or completely destroyed by bank erosion. Banks are steeper, making it more difficult to get to portages. On land, unseasonably wet conditions quickly deteriorate trails and sometimes make them impassible.</p>
  <p>As they traversed the landscape, observers reported seeing more sinkholes, which are likely related to thawing permafrost. In the summer, these holes fill with water and sometimes cut off trail access. In winter, sinkholes create conditions that are easy to get stuck in and difficult to navigate through. All of these environmental changes have made for slower and more uncertain travel conditions throughout the year.</p>

  <h2>Vegetation and fire</h2>
  <p>Lakes now contain more vegetation, or are drying up and being replaced by thick shrubs. Thicker brush on trails makes travel more difficult and requires more trail maintenance. Some airstrips are no longer usable because of brush expansion. Excess lake vegetation clogs boat motors or becomes entangled in propellers. In some cases lakes are drying up altogether. This is changing both the travel methods that are possible for people in those areas as well as the distribution of fish, birds, or wildlife harvested in those areas.</p>
  <p>Fire rapidly changes the landscape. Forest fires are a part of the natural cycle of the boreal forest and can improve moose and berry harvest opportunities. However, increasing fire frequency and intensity can hinder travel. After a fire, trails can be very obstructed and difficult to find. Accessing a trail for the first time after a fire requires a lot of work to clear slash, often with a chainsaw. Even after the initial clearing of a trail, trees will continue to fall for years after a forest fire and require continual trail maintenance.</p>

      <h4>Vegetation changes</h4>
      <p>These are areas of <strong>vegetation changes</strong> that affect travel and access. Observer reports include the presence of more vegetation, falling trees from fires and erosion, and changes to vegetation from fire.</p>

      <h4>Historical fires</h4>
      <p>This map indicates that the majority of areas burned has occurred in more recent decades (red shades). More fire on the landscape is resulting in more impacts to communities.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Environmental changes are affecting people in many ways as they traverse the landscape. In many cases, travel is <em>more dangerous</em> as a result of conditions such as open water during winter, or more debris in the rivers during summer. Some changes are <em>harder on equipment</em>, like boat motors clogging more often or having to navigate rougher, eroded terrain. Some travel routes are being <em>damaged or cut off</em> by things like erosion and high water levels. In some cases, access can improve&mdash;for example, high water levels in fall have allowed travel up small streams that may have previously been unnavigable.</p>
  <p>Some hunting, fishing, trapping, and gathering opportunities are reduced or even missed, with increased variability in seasonal weather and physical events such as the timing of fall freeze-up and spring break-up. River ice in spring deteriorates faster, increasing the amount of time when river travel by snowmachine is unsafe yet still impossible by boat. Higher water levels and warm temperatures during a time a year that was previously noted for having less precipitation and cool temperatures affects fall hunting opportunities.</p>
  <p>With these changes, people are having to find ways to adjust when or how they travel, and adapt to different conditions that often make it harder to access important harvest resources.</p>

      This figure summarizes past and present environmental conditions that people in Interior Alaska have experienced, and how changes in environmental conditions may limit access to hunting, fishing, trapping, or gathering. This diagram is illustrative only, and may not fully capture all of the variation experienced across Interior Alaska.

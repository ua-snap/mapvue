<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&rsquo;s (IPCC) 5th Assessment Report (AR5) describes four different potential future scenarios using <strong>Representative Concentration Pathways</strong> (RCPs).</p>

<p>RCPs are the latest set of international climate scenarios used to model potential future climates. RCP data are used to ensure that modelers start from the same place, using values everyone is familiar with. RCPs reduce duplication, save money, and provide a &ldquo;common language&rdquo; for comparing results and sharing findings.</p>

<p>Each RCP sets levels for the concentration of greenhouse gases and how much the planet has heated up for the year 2100. These become &ldquo;pathways&rdquo; to the end of the 21st century.</p>

<p>RCPs illustrate three major values:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Radiative forcing</strong>&mdash;how much sunlight is trapped in Earthâ€™s atmosphere vs. being reflected back into space</li>
  <li><strong>Emission rates</strong>&mdash;how fast we add greenhouse gases into the atmosphere</li>
  <li><strong>Emission concentrations</strong>&mdash;measured in parts per million for CO2, methane, and other greenhouse gases</li>
</ul>
<p>RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5 are the four major pathways. The numbers refer to levels of radiative forcings, measured in watts per square meter (W/m^2), by the year 2100.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>RCP 2.6</strong>: Forcing peaks at ~3 W/m&sup2; mid-century and drops to 2.6 W/m&sup2; by 2100. Greenhouse gas emissions drop substantially over time.</li>
  <li><strong>RCPs 4.5 and 6.0</strong>: Forcing stabilizes soon after 2100 at 4.5 and 6.0 W/m&sup2;, respectively, due to efforts that curb emissions.</li>
  <li><strong>RCP 8.5</strong>: Very high greenhouse gas concentrations. Radiative forcing values reach 8.5 W/m&sup2; by 2100 and continue to rise into the next century. Very high greenhouse gas concentrations.</li>

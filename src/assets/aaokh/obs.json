Loaded up early before any weather happens. Thought I was too bored so I took some photos also [CTD] drop twice. Could see the village near and up right of photos. Possible 35- 40 drop to sea floor.

Look a little less murky than last summer. Got to take photos of my net and hope for [CTD] drop only by 17 ft. KAYAK. No real change in fish just very few smelt in winter ice fishing but inland birds have migrated to coast. Small ducks and hawks and the others. Inland fish must be elsewhere like west drainages and small rivers. No out of place just differ in size.",

After a period of time with prominent North to Northeast winds left slush to freeze flat with intermittent or little movement until a complete freeze. On the outer edge of the shorefast ice there are pressure ridges ranging from residual ice to collection of ice from current from the ocean or winds. Pressure ridges from a foot to 50 feet or more can be seen in front of the community. In front of the community approximately a mile or two, you can notice open water or moving ice flow as seen on the horizon of this photo. Where the ice ridges to the free ice indicates a steady current that lies in this area. We have two currents and switches directions in the Spring and Fall time. Lately, there has been a handful of local ice fisherman trying to hug for Blue Cod fish on the south side of our community on the other side of what is know as 'the point' which is a prime location for small fish, number of seals, and historically a crabbing site also. We are approaching hunting of the Bowhead Whale and Walrus to follow while seeing seals amongst them. ",
